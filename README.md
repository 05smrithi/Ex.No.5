**EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS**

**Aim:** 
<br>To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

**AI Tools Required:** ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

**Explanation:**

**Define the Two Prompt Types:**
Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

**Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:**
Select various scenarios such as:
1. Generating a creative story.
2.Answering a factual question.
3. Summarizing an article or concept.
4. Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario

For each scenario, create both a na√Øve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.

**Run Experiments with ChatGPT:**
Input the na√Øve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.

**Evaluate Responses : **
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given na√Øve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where na√Øve prompts work equally well?
	
**Deliverables:**
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to na√Øve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT‚Äôs outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.


**OUTPUT**
**Types of Prompts:**

**Naive Prompt:**

A broad, unstructured prompt with minimal details or unclear instructions.

Example: ‚ÄúWrite about space.‚Äù

**Basic (Refined) Prompt:**

A clear, detailed, and structured prompt providing specific context and expected output format.

Example: ‚ÄúWrite a 100-word paragraph describing the challenges faced by astronauts in deep space missions, focusing on health and communication issues.‚Äù

**SCENARIO TYPE 1: Creative Story Generation**

Naive prompt : Write a story about a bird.
Output: üïäÔ∏è Story: The Little Bird
         Once upon a time, there was a small bird who lived on a tall tree near a river. Every morning, she sang sweet songs that made everyone happy. One day, a storm came and broke her nest. The little bird was sad but didn‚Äôt give up. She flew around, collected twigs, and built a new nest stronger than before. When the sun rose again, she sang even louder ‚Äî a song of hope and courage.

Refined prompt: Write a 120-word story about a bird that builds an electronic nest using smart technology to protect its eggs from rain.
Output:        In a busy city, a small sparrow collected shiny wires and chips from old gadgets. With her clever mind, she built an electronic nest that warmed her eggs and alerted her during storms. The nest glowed softly at night, symbolizing how nature and technology could live in harmony.

**Observation: The basic prompt produced a creative, detailed, and context-rich story. The na√Øve prompt lacked imagination and structure.**

**SCENARIO TYPE 2: Factual Explanation**

Naive prompt: Tell me about sensors.
Output: Sensors are devices that detect changes in the environment. They are used in many applications.

Refined prompt: Explain the working principle of a temperature sensor and mention one real-time example in IoT-based healthcare.
Output: A temperature sensor measures heat levels by converting thermal energy into electrical signals. In IoT healthcare, it helps monitor a patient‚Äôs body temperature in real time using wearable devices, enabling automatic alerts to doctors when fever is detected.

**Observation : The basic prompt directed ChatGPT to focus on function and real-world context, improving accuracy and depth**

**SCENARIO TYPE 3: Summarization**

Naive prompt: Summarize Artificial Intelligence.
Output: AI is a technology that makes machines smart. It helps in automation and learning.

Refined prompt: Summarize Artificial Intelligence in 3‚Äì4 lines, focusing on its role in automation and data-driven decision-making.
Output: Artificial Intelligence enables systems to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make intelligent decisions with minimal human input. It powers automation in industries and supports data-driven innovations across healthcare, transport, and business.

**Observation: The refined prompt ensured targeted and meaningful summarization, avoiding vague explanations.**

**SCENARIO TYPE 4: Recommendation / Advice**

Naive prompt: Give me some study tips.
Output: Read books, study daily, and concentrate. Take breaks and revise.

Refined prompt: Suggest five effective study techniques for engineering students preparing for exams, focusing on time management and retention.
Output: 
1. Use Pomodoro technique for focused 25-min study sessions.
2. Prioritize tough subjects first.
3. Revise using flowcharts and flashcards.
4. Discuss key topics with peers. 
5. Sleep well before exams to retain memory.

**Observation: The basic prompt produced structured, practical, and domain-specific advice.**

**SCENARIO TYPE 5: Concept Explanation**

Naive prompt: What is IoT?
Output: IoT stands for Internet of Things. It connects devices and makes them smart.

Refined prompt: Explain the Internet of Things (IoT) with an example showing how it improves city traffic management.
Output: IoT connects sensors, cameras, and signals across the city to form smart traffic systems. Data from vehicles and GPS units is analyzed in real time, automatically adjusting signals to reduce congestion and give priority to emergency vehicles like ambulances.

**Observation : The basic prompt yielded an applied and contextual explanation connected to real-world usage.**

**SCENARIO TYPE 6: Analytical / Comparative Question**

Naive prompt: Which is better, solar or wind energy?
Output: Both are renewable sources of energy and good for the environment.

Refined prompt: Compare solar and wind energy based on installation cost, efficiency, and environmental impact in 4‚Äì5 lines.
Output: Solar energy has lower maintenance and works best in sunny regions, while wind energy is efficient in coastal or hilly areas. Solar panels are easier to install, but wind turbines generate more power in favorable conditions. Both are clean and sustainable options.

**Observation: The basic prompt provided structured comparison points, improving clarity and analytical depth.**
